# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**API stability (as of v1.0.0).** The public Python API, the solver/selector
extension interfaces (`Solver`, `MarkerSelector`, `BaseSimulator`), and the CLI
contract (command names, options, and the exit-code policy) are **stable**:
breaking changes to them require a major-version bump and a deprecation cycle
(deprecate → keep working for one minor release → remove in the next major). The
YAML run-configuration schema (`scdecon.config`) is intentionally **not** frozen
and may change in a minor release; such changes are documented here.

Releases correspond to development milestones (M0 → v0.1.0, M1 → v0.2.0, …).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-13 — First stable release (M9)

First stable release. From this version, the public Python API, the solver
interfaces, and the CLI contract are stable and covered by the deprecation policy
described at the top of this file; the YAML run-configuration schema is
intentionally **not** frozen and may still evolve.

### Added
- **Dockerfile** (single-stage) + `.dockerignore` for reproducibly running the
  CLI and the Snakemake pipeline in a container; a Docker image smoke test in CI.
- **Documentation site** (MkDocs Material + mkdocstrings API reference),
  published to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.
- **`CITATION.cff`** so the repository is citable.
- Documentation figures under `docs/assets/`, regenerated deterministically by
  `docs/generate_figures.py`.

### Changed
- **README overhaul**: hero, badges, quickstart (CLI / Snakemake / Docker),
  benchmark figures, and a citation section.
- **API freeze at 1.0.0**: the library API, the `Solver`/`MarkerSelector`
  extension interfaces, and the CLI command/exit-code contract are now Stable and
  covered by the deprecation policy. Documentation build tooling added as an
  optional `docs` extra.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-13 — CLI, configuration & Snakemake pipeline (M8)

### Added — package (`scdecon`)
- `scdecon.config` — a Pydantic run-configuration schema (`RunConfig` + typed
  sub-models) that parses/validates a YAML run file and constructs the existing
  frozen parameter dataclasses. It is a declarative validation boundary: the
  frozen dataclasses remain the single source of truth for defaults and range
  validation (only user-set fields are forwarded), and it builds no solver
  instances.
- `scdecon.cli` — a Typer command-line interface and composition root exposing
  `version`, `build-signature`, `simulate`, `deconvolve`, and `benchmark`. It
  loads config, constructs objects (including the solver), calls existing public
  library functions, and maps outcomes to a documented exit-code policy
  (0 success, 1 unexpected, 2 usage, 3 config, 4 input, 5 computation). No
  scientific logic lives in the CLI (ADR-0013).
- A `scdecon` console entry point (`scdecon.cli:app`) declared in
  `pyproject.toml`.

### Added — orchestration & tooling (not package API)
- `workflow/Snakefile` + `config/example_run.yaml` — a Snakemake pipeline that
  reproduces `build-signature → simulate → deconvolve → benchmark` by shelling
  out to the `scdecon` CLI (no rule imports Python modules). The run-config file
  is shared by the workflow and the CLI, so it stays a valid `RunConfig`.
- End-to-end integration tests (`tests/integration/`): the CLI pipeline (runs
  everywhere) and the Snakemake execution (skipped unless Snakemake is
  installed). A dedicated CI job installs the `pipeline` extra and runs both.

### Changed
- New runtime dependencies: `typer`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`. New optional extra
  `pipeline` (`snakemake`) for running the workflow; dev extra gains
  `types-PyYAML`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-11 — Release readiness (M7.5)

### Fixed
- `scdecon.__version__` now reports the release version instead of the
  placeholder `0.0.0`; the distribution metadata matches on (re)install.

### Added
- `py.typed` marker (PEP 561) + packaging config, so `scdecon`'s type hints are
  exported to downstream consumers.
- Coverage measurement via `pytest-cov` (built into `pytest`); coverage is 96%
  (package + scripts). Two targeted tests for previously untested public error
  contracts (`align_proportions` duplicate sample labels; `read_metadata` empty).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10 — Real tumour data & expression-space harmonisation (M7)

### Added — package (`scdecon`)
- `scdecon.genes` — generic, dataset-agnostic gene-identifier harmonisation:
  `strip_ensembl_version`, `relabel_gene_index` (relabel a gene-indexed matrix
  through an id→id mapping, collapsing collisions), and `GeneAggregation`
  (`SUM`/`MEAN`).
- `scdecon.genes.GeneMappingCoverage` + `compute_mapping_coverage` — a
  first-class mapping-coverage QC metric; `relabel_gene_index` warns below a
  configurable `min_coverage` and rejects non-numeric columns.

### Added — scripts (`scripts/`, dataset-specific; **not** package API)
- `scripts/datasets/` — dataset ingestion: recount3 `gene_sums` loader, GENCODE
  GTF → gene-symbol map, and the Tirosh GSE72056 scRNA loader (cell-type decoding
  + `log2(TPM/10+1)` → linear-TPM reconstruction so the existing signature
  pipeline applies unchanged).
- `scripts/download_data.py` — idempotent downloader: SHA-256 checksums, atomic
  writes, `Content-Length` verification, and a JSON provenance manifest (standard
  library only; data is never committed).
- `scripts/melanoma_workflow.py` — the end-to-end TCGA-SKCM workflow, including
  `harmonize_expression_space` (configurable per-gene scaling `mean`/`max`/`l2`)
  and a before/after QC comparison.

### Changed
- Architecture guardrails extended: `scdecon.genes` must stay dataset-agnostic
  (no io/plotting/anndata/scanpy), and the `scdecon` package must not import the
  `scripts/` package (dependency flows scripts → scdecon only).

### Documentation
- `docs/tutorials/melanoma-tme.md` — real-data walkthrough documenting the
  baseline failure, the finding that **length normalisation (as implemented) did
  not resolve it**, the expression-space harmonisation (with its `D⁻¹` /
  weighted-NNLS justification), and the T+NK-vs-cytotoxicity **sanity check**
  (Spearman 0.08 → 0.74; partially circular — see the tutorial caveats). Separates
  demonstrated results from interpretation throughout.
- ADR-0010 — real-data ingestion: generic harmonisation in `src/`, dataset
  specifics in `scripts/`.
- Expanded known limitations: relative (not absolute) fractions, no TCGA ground
  truth, Smart-seq2 vs recount3 platform differences, NK/CD8-T
  non-identifiability, and harmonisation being evidence-supported (not proven
  uniquely optimal).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-09 — Additional solvers & benchmarking (M6)

### Added
- `NuSVRSolver` (+ `NuSVRConfig`) — CIBERSORT-style linear ν-support-vector
  regression (scikit-learn), coefficients clipped to ≥0 and renormalised.
- `RobustSolver` (+ `RobustConfig`, `RobustLoss`) — robust non-negative
  regression via `scipy.optimize.least_squares` (`soft_l1` default, `huber`
  optional). Both implement the existing `Solver` contract.
- `scikit-learn` added as a direct dependency (isolated to the ν-SVR solver).
- `run_benchmark` + `BenchmarkResult` — a solver-agnostic, fair-by-construction
  benchmark harness: the signature/bulk are aligned once and every supplied
  solver is scored over the identical inputs with the same metrics. Depends only
  on the `Solver` interface (enforced by a guardrail); solver names are preserved
  exactly; runtimes are informational only.
- `scdecon.plotting.plot_benchmark` — per-solver metric bar chart.

### Changed
- Architecture guardrails extended: scikit-learn is imported only by
  `deconvolution/nusvr.py`, and `deconvolution/benchmark.py` imports no concrete
  solver. `plotting` now also depends on `deconvolution` (for `BenchmarkResult`).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-09 — Pseudobulk simulation & validation framework (M5)

### Added
- `scdecon.simulation` package (M5):
  - `SimulationConfig` (frozen, validated) and `ProportionPrior` (StrEnum).
  - `split_reference` — a deterministic, cell-type-stratified split into disjoint
    signature / held-out partitions, preventing leakage between signature
    construction and pseudobulk simulation.
  - `BaseSimulator` / `CellSumSimulator` / `simulate_pseudobulk` — generate
    pseudobulk by summing the raw counts of single cells drawn (with replacement)
    at multinomial-sampled proportions; the **realised** proportions are recorded
    as ground truth.
  - `PseudobulkDataset` — `bulk` (genes × samples) and `proportions`
    (cell types × samples, matching `deconvolve`'s orientation).
- `scdecon.validation` package (M5):
  - `align_proportions` — strict alignment of truth/prediction proportion frames
    (identical cell-type and sample labels).
  - `evaluate` → `ValidationReport` — overall + per-cell-type RMSE, Pearson, and
    Spearman across samples; a lightweight, stable result object.
- `scdecon.plotting.plot_truth_vs_prediction` — truth-vs-prediction scatter grid.
- End-to-end recovery test proving the full pipeline (split → signature →
  simulate → deconvolve → evaluate) recovers known composition on synthetic data.

### Changed
- Architecture guardrail extended: `scdecon.simulation` and `scdecon.validation`
  must not import `scdecon.io` or the plotting stack. `plotting` now depends on
  `validation` (for shared truth/prediction alignment).

### Documentation
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format).
- Recorded the API-stability policy (stability tiers, deprecation policy, and the
  semantic-versioning strategy).
- Updating the changelog and the API-stability policy is now part of the
  Definition of Done for every release.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-09 — First end-to-end deconvolution workflow (M4)

### Added
- `scdecon.deconvolution` package:
  - `Solver` — abstract, format-agnostic solver interface (NumPy arrays only);
    `fit(signature, bulk) -> p` with `p >= 0` and `sum(p) == 1`.
  - `NNLSSolver` — non-negative least squares (`scipy.optimize.nnls`) minimising
    `‖S·x − b‖₂` subject to `x >= 0`, renormalised to `sum(p) == 1`; raises
    `ValueError` on a degenerate all-zero solution.
  - `align_signature_and_bulk` / `AlignedInputs` — a pandas-aware adapter that
    restricts a signature and bulk matrix to their shared genes (in signature row
    order) with a configurable low-overlap warning (`min_overlap`, default 0.5).
  - `deconvolve` — orchestrator returning per-sample proportions as a
    `cell types × samples` DataFrame.
- `scipy` added as a direct runtime dependency.
- Permanent solver regression tests: exact recovery (canonical), scale
  invariance, non-negativity, sum-to-one, determinism, small-noise recovery,
  degenerate all-zero → error, and input non-mutation.

### Changed
- Architecture guardrail (`tests/unit/test_architecture.py`) extended: the
  deconvolution layer must not import io/plotting/anndata/scanpy, and the
  solver-core modules must be NumPy/SciPy-only.

### Documentation
- Established the Architecture Decision Records
  (`docs/architecture/ADR-0001`–`ADR-0009`) and the project's design-history docs.
  Documentation became part of the Definition of Done.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-09 — Signature matrix generation (M3)

### Added
- `scdecon.signature` package:
  - `RankMethod` (StrEnum) and `SignatureConfig` (frozen, validated).
  - `MarkerSelector` strategy interface with `RankGenesGroupsSelector` (Scanpy
    `rank_genes_groups`, one-vs-rest, plus a cross-type specificity filter),
    `MarkerSet`, and `select_markers`.
  - `build_signature` — assembles the signature matrix as a validated
    `DataFrame` (genes × sorted cell types), using arithmetic-mean **linear-scale**
    profiles; row order is exactly `MarkerSet.genes()`.
- `scdecon.plotting.plot_signature_heatmap` — headless-safe signature heatmap.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` added as direct runtime dependencies.

### Changed
- Architecture guardrail extended so the computational core (io, preprocessing,
  signature) imports neither `scdecon.plotting` nor matplotlib/seaborn.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-09 — Single-cell preprocessing pipeline (M2)

### Added
- `scdecon.logging_utils` — `configure_logging`, `get_logger` (structured,
  idempotent, namespaced logging).
- `scdecon.preprocessing` package:
  - `PreprocessConfig` (frozen, validated) — the single source of truth for
    QC/normalisation parameters (no magic numbers).
  - `compute_qc_metrics` (in-place metadata), `filter_cells_and_genes`
    (non-destructive) + `QCSummary`, `normalize` (raw counts preserved in
    `layers["counts"]`; refuses to double-normalise), and the `preprocess`
    orchestrator (QC summary stored at `.uns["scdecon_qc_summary"]`).
- `scanpy` added as a direct runtime dependency.
- First static architecture guardrail test.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09 — Data I/O layer (M1)

### Added
- `scdecon.io` package: readers (`read_h5ad`, `read_bulk`, `read_metadata`) and
  writers (`write_table`, `write_h5ad`). Paths accept `str | Path` and normalise
  to `pathlib.Path`; bulk matrices use a fixed genes × samples orientation;
  structural-only validation with actionable errors; data preserved exactly.
- `anndata`, `numpy`, `pandas` runtime dependencies; `pandas-stubs` dev
  dependency; small committed text fixtures.

### Fixed
- Removed the pinned mypy `python_version = "3.11"`, which caused CI failures on
  Python 3.12/3.13 when mypy parsed NumPy's PEP 695 (`type` statement) stubs under
  a 3.11 target. mypy now infers the target from the interpreter; the 3.11 CI job
  still enforces the language floor. (See ADR-0002.)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08 — Project scaffold & development infrastructure (M0)

### Added
- Installable `src/`-layout Python package (`scdecon`) built with setuptools,
  with a dynamic version.
- Tooling: ruff (lint + format), mypy (strict), pytest — all configured in
  `pyproject.toml`; pre-commit hooks.
- GitHub Actions CI (lint → format → type-check → test) across Python
  3.11/3.12/3.13.
- MIT license, README, smoke test, conda `environment.yml`
  (conda-forge + bioconda), `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`.
